# Pre-install

1. Go to [https://discord.com/developers/applications/](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
2. Hit the "New Application" button in the top right.
3. Give it a good name. This will be what the main text says!
4. Navigate to the "Rich Presence" tab in the left bar. It should be the 4th option down.
5. Go down to "Rich Presence Assets". You don't need a cover/invite image, don't worry!
6. Upload either one or two images. One will be used for the large image, and the other will be used for the small image. Both are optional. In the example screenshots, I only uploaded one image (for a large image). Give them memorable names! (Note: sometimes they don't show up directly after being uploaded. This is normal.)
7. Go back to the "General Information" tab in the left bar. 
8. Copy your Client ID. It should be a big number, and is underneath the description on the left-hand. Hold on to this, it's important! (No, you do NOT need a Client Secret.)

# Install

1. Go to the top and click on your OS's icon (Windows, macOS, Linux, Alpine) or go to the [releases page](https://github.com/ThatOneCalculator/DiscordRPCMaker/releases).
2. Choose the latest version, and download the zip file for your given system. 
3. Install.
- Windows: 
  - Download the msi.
  - Run the installer.
  - Note: on Windows 10, you may have to hit More Info > Run Anyway.
- macOS:
  - Download the pkg.
  - Run the installer.
- Linux:
  - Download and extract the Linux zip. (Alpine users, download the Alpine zip!)
  - Open your terminal emulator of choice.
  - `cd` into the extracted folder.
  - `sudo ./install.sh`.
4. Run rpcmaker, and follow the instructions there.
  - macOS users: You may not be able to open it at first. If it doesn't let you run it, the Applications folder, find the app, right click and hit open (the first option).
5. Open Discord.
6. Run drpc, and watch your presence spring to life!
  - macOS instructions from step 4 apply here as well.

If you want to edit your presence, re-run rpcmaker.

***Congrats, you're done!***
